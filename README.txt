# Construction Project Dashboard: IJMC Ramp Access Scaffolding

## 📊 Executive Summary
This Power BI dashboard was developed to manage the end-to-end lifecycle of the IJMC Ramp Access scaffolding project. It serves as a central operational tool for Project Managers and Safety Officers to monitor construction progress, ensure safety compliance (Green Tag inspections), and optimize material inventory.

The dashboard consolidates data from site inspections, logistics, and construction teams into a "single-pane-of-glass" view to facilitate rapid decision-making.

## 🖼️ Dashboard Visuals & Features

### 1. Full Operational Overview

*A comprehensive view of the project status, combining safety data, physical progress, and logistics metrics on a single canvas.*

### 2. Location-Based Filtering
![Location Filter](2.png)
* **Feature:** Dynamic Location Slicing.
* **Function:** Allows site supervisors to drill down into specific project areas (e.g., "Level 2 Ramp Access - Main Building Connection"). Selecting a location automatically filters the inspection logs and progress charts to show only relevant data.

### 3. Safety & Inspection Tracking (Green Tag Status)
![Inspection Details](3.png)
* **Feature:** Inspection Log & Failure Analysis.
* **Function:** Monitors the "Green Tag" status of scaffolding structures. It highlights critical safety data including:
    * Inspection dates (Last vs. Next Due).
    * Pass/Fail status for specific Scaffold IDs.
    * **Root Cause Analysis:** Detailed logging of failure reasons (e.g., "Missing toe boards," "Minor corrosion") to expedite
